                    <h3>The Passport That Refused to Travel</h3>
                    <h4>How I Almost Missed My Trip to Australia Because of… Myself</h4>
                    <p>I was all set for an Australia trip with my friends—me flying from Tokyo, them from Osaka. I arrived at Haneda after
                    work, grabbed a quick dinner, and headed to the immigration gate.

                    That’s when things went sideways. The officer called a colleague, whispered something, and then said:
                    
                    “Could you come with me, please?”
                    
                    My stomach sank. Had I done something wrong? In the office, the verdict came:
                    “This passport is invalid.”
                    
                    Invalid?! Then it hit me—years ago, I lost my passport, got a new one… and somehow, in the chaos of moving, I had
                    grabbed the old one. Yes, I had been trying to travel with an expired passport.
                    
                    Cue the dramatic facepalm.
                    
                    I went home by taxi in the pouring rain past midnight, called my friends to break the bad news, and cried a little. But,
                    of course, I didn’t give up. The next morning, I dug through mountains of luggage, found the correct passport, booked a
                    new flight, and finally made it to Australia.
                    
                    The takeaway? If your passport could talk, mine would have yelled: “Not today, buddy!”</p>

                    <h3>The Great Hong Kong Countdown Mix-Up</h3>
                    <h4>How a Simple Date Mix-Up Almost Made Me Celebrate Alone</h4>
                    <p>My mom and I had planned a Hong Kong trip for New Year’s. Countdowns, fireworks, city lights—we were ready for it all.
                    
                    I arrived at Kansai Airport around noon, called my mom:
                    “Mom, are you leaving yet?”
                    
                    Her reply:
                    “Wait… isn’t the flight tomorrow?”
                    
                    Cue the record scratch. My ticket said 2 a.m. on December 29—so technically, just after midnight—but my mom had firmly
                    decided it was the evening of the 29th. She had mistaken the date entirely.
                    
                    I tried to convince her to rush, but my ever-organized mom had her priorities straight: the house needed tidying, the
                    dog needed a pet hotel… no way could she leave right now. “You go ahead,” she said. “I’m staying home.”
                    
                    I sulked. I was about to spend New Year’s in Hong Kong alone. Drama ensued.
                    
                    But I’m persistent. The next day, I found a flight, negotiated with her, and somehow managed to snag a rare,
                    reasonably-priced ticket during the holiday chaos. Mom finally arrived—just one day late.
                    
                    In the end, we watched the fireworks, admired the “million-dollar” skyline, visited temples, and enjoyed our holiday
                    together.
                    
                    Lesson learned: never trust your calendar… and always double-check your mom.</p>

                    <h3>The €150 Lesson in Montmartre</h3>
                    <h4>How I Let My Excitement Cost Me Big in Paris</h4>
                    <p>Over New Year’s, my best friend and I reunited in Paris for a two-week European trip. Seeing her at the airport felt
                    like a movie moment, and our excitement was through the roof. We dropped our luggage at the hotel and headed straight to
                    Montmartre, famous for Amélie, snapping photos, buying fresh bread, and talking nonstop.
                    
                    That’s when we spotted a street game: a ball hidden under cups, shuffled around, and the challenge was to guess which
                    cup held it. A crowd had gathered, and one person asked if I wanted to try. Normally, I would have said no—but somehow,
                    I said “Sure!” and bet €100, feeling inexplicably confident.
                    
                    Of course, I lost. Not one to admit defeat easily, I threw in another €50… and lost again. Finally, reality hit: this
                    was a classic scam. €150 gone in seconds, all because my excitement got the better of me.
                    
                    Despite the mini disaster, our trip continued beautifully. Montmartre’s charm, Christmas markets in France and Spain,
                    and counting down to the New Year in Barcelona made it unforgettable.
                    
                    Lesson learned: never trust street games, and never let excitement cloud your judgment—€150 can disappear in a blink!</p>

                            once-in-a-lifetime adventure. I also want to explore the historic cities of Fes and Marrakech and taste authentic
